# Course Structure


## Aims of Module

The purpose of this module is to provide an introduction to quantum computing with an emphasis on being able to run quantum circuits on existing and near-term quantum computers. It will introduce essential concepts from quantum mechanics and quantum information, as well as exploring how quantum computers may be utilised in the context of machine learning. It will introduce the language of quantum computing—qubits, unitary quantum gates, and quantum circuits—and we will consider how quantum parallelism may provide an advantage over existing numerical methods. It will additionally cover the basics of python APIs pennylane and qiskit for programming the IBM quantum computers, with the goal of running simple quantum circuits on simulated and real quantum computers.

## Learning Outcomes

On completion of the module, students should: 
* be familiar with quantum states of multiple qubits, including the concepts of superposition, entanglement, and projective measurements;
* be able to understand and draw quantum circuit diagrams;
* be able to write simple scripts to run quantum circuits on simulated and real IBM quantum computers.

## Syllabus

The module will be in the style of student-centred learning, based on projects and presentations, and guided by tutorial sessions. The objective is to cover three general and interrelated set of ideas and methods: 

1. Essential Quantum Mechanics
    * Qubits: quantum states and superpositions. 
    * Entanglement: exponential Hilbert space, exponential computing power?
    * Projective measurements, bases, and tomography.
    * Unitary operators.
2. Quantum Circuits and Algorithms
    * From classical gates to quantum gates: Universal quantum gates.
    * Graphical quantum circuit notation.
    * Important one-, two- and multi-qubit gates.
    * Quantum algorithms and quantum parallelism.
3. Programming near-term Quantum Computers
    * Basics of qiskit python api for programming IBM quantum computers.
    * Running quantum circuits on a simulated quantum computer.
    * Running quantum circuits on a real quantum computer.
    * Test basic quantum mechanics.

## Assessment

* Project and paper (as a group): 70%
* Presentation and discussion (individual): 30%
* **PAPER DEADLINE 4pm May 13th, 2025 (submit via Moodle)**
* **Presentation date TBD after papers submitted** 

## Lectures and Tutorials

Lectures and Tutorials will be held in person Tuesday 11am-1pm (Pope-A24) starting Tuesday 28th January.

The first six sessions will be lectures covering the course content. The remaining sessions will be tutorials where you will be working on your group projects. 

## Contact Details

We are happy to discuss the material covered in the module at any reasonable time. The easiest time to see us is at the end of a session. “Office hours” for this module are those of the sessions. Outside these times, one-to-one meetings can be arranged by email to [Dr. Adam Gammon-Smith](mailto:adam.gammon-smith@nottingham.ac.uk).
